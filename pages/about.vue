const bodyText = "Hi! I'm Jan. I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Ateneo de Zamboanga University. I am passionate about technology and programming, and I love learning new things along the way. Currently, I am into web development, particularly UI and full-stack frameworks. I also dabble in AI and machine learning, and watch videos on the latest tech updates. \n\nIn addition to tech and programming, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones and friends. I like going to cafes to hang out and draw. I also like playing casual video games and watching 4-hour video essays on said games."
